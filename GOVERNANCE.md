# Project Governance

## Overview

py-aps is an open source project developed and maintained by **voidbox**. This document outlines how the project is governed and how decisions are made.

## Governance Model

py-aps follows a **company-led open source model**. The project is licensed under Apache-2.0, making it freely available to use, modify, and distribute, but the development direction and architecture decisions are primarily made by the voidbox team.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Maintainers

**voidbox team members** serve as the core maintainers with the following responsibilities:

- Define the project roadmap and priorities
- Review and merge pull requests
- Make architectural decisions
- Manage releases and versioning
- Maintain documentation
- Provide technical support through GitHub Issues

### Contributors

Community members can contribute in the following ways:

- **Issue Reporting**: Report bugs and request features
- **Documentation**: Improve documentation and examples
- **Code Contributions**: Submit pull requests (subject to maintainer approval)
- **Community Support**: Help other users in discussions

## Decision Making Process

### Development Priorities

Development priorities and feature roadmap are set by the voidbox team based on:

- Business requirements
- User feedback and feature requests
- Technical considerations
- Resource availability

### Pull Request Review

All code changes must be reviewed and approved by voidbox maintainers. The review process considers:

- Alignment with project architecture and goals
- Code quality and test coverage
- Documentation completeness
- Maintenance burden

**Note:** Not all pull requests may be accepted. Maintainers may close PRs that don't align with project direction or have significant maintenance concerns.

## Communication Channels

- **GitHub Issues**: Bug reports and feature requests
- **GitHub Discussions**: General questions and community discussions
- **GitHub Pull Requests**: Code contributions

## Release Process

Releases are managed by voidbox maintainers following semantic versioning (SemVer):

- **Major versions** (x.0.0): Breaking changes
- **Minor versions** (0.x.0): New features, backward compatible
- **Patch versions** (0.0.x): Bug fixes, backward compatible

## Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a welcoming and inclusive environment. All participants are expected to:

- Be respectful and professional
- Accept constructive criticism gracefully
- Focus on what is best for the project and community
- Show empathy towards other community members

Violations may result in temporary or permanent bans from project participation.

## Changes to Governance

This governance document may be updated by voidbox maintainers as the project evolves. Significant changes will be communicated through GitHub releases and announcements.
